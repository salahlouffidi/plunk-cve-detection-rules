# Splunk CVE Detection Rules

This project generates Splunk detection rules for CVE IDs by utilizing the OpenAI API. It reads the CVE IDs from a CSV file and retrieves the corresponding detection rules using natural language generation. The generated rules can be used to enhance security monitoring and threat detection in Splunk environments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/salahlouffidi/splunk-cve-detection-rules.git


Obtain an OpenAI API key:

Sign up on the OpenAI website if you don't have an account.
Generate an API key in your account settings.


Update the API key in the code:


Open the file generate_detection_rules.py.
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.
Prepare the CSV file:
Create a CSV file named trans.csv in the project directory.
Add the CVE IDs you want to generate Splunk detection rules for. Place each ID in a separate row in the first column.

Usage
python generate_detection_rules.py

The script will read the CVE IDs from the CSV file and generate Splunk detection rules using the OpenAI API.
The generated rules will be displayed in the console for each CVE ID.
